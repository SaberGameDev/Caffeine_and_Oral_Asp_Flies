# Caffeine_and_Oral_Asp_Flies
RStudio code for statistical analysis of drosophila melanogaster lifespan when orally aspirated with and without the researcher drinking coffee

Hello! This is the script developed by Victoria Makovetski and Maya Thompson for an undergraduate-level study on the effects of caffeine residuals from human researchers on the lifespan of orally aspirated D. melanogaster.

Given our current time constraint, we were unable to produce a GLMM that fit our needs, so we are working with the next best non-parametric tests. If we develop one in the future, the updated script will be uploaded separately.

The uploaded R-script is the final version used to perform statistics and generate figures presented in the final report.

Please don't hesitate to ask questions if need be.

Thank you,
V. Makovetski and M. Thompson
